              A student run robotics competition hosted by iRobotics, 
              with teams from the surrounding areas. There's different obstacles and objectives from shooting 
              balls to crossing bumpy bridges for our eight-week robot to try to overcome and complete. 
              I was mainly involved in configuring the circuits and putting together the final pieces of the 
              robot.

              A cyber security club where students lead meetings on various 
              topics on information security from game hacking to cryptography. I stay active in 
              the club by attending their weekly meetings and completing challenges on their

      <p>In the future I would like to learn more about the programming side of robotics, mainly combining that with 
        machine learning to train and gather data on how a physical robot functions. I am taking classes in both 
        electrical engineering and computer science to understand and bridge the gap between the controls 
        and coding side of a robot.</p>
      <p>I have interned at American Family Insurance in Madison, WI this past summer where I learned a lot about how 
        a large company functions and working in a team. I helped to automate a large section of their data 
        preparation process for reports using Python. I also leveraged Tableau, a data visualization tool, to set 
        guidelines for converting desktop dashboards to mobile phones.</p>
