    <h1>About</h1>
    <div>
        <p>I'm currently a member in MRDC (robotics competition team) and SIGPwny (cyber security club) at UIUC.</p>
        <p class="description"><a href=http://mrdc.ec.illinois.edu/>MRDC</a> is a student run robotics competition 
            hosted by iRobotics, with teams from the surrounding areas. There's different obstacles and objectives from 
            shooting balls to crossing bumpy bridges for our eight-week robot to try to overcome and complete. I was 
            mainly involved in configuring the circuits and putting together the final pieces of the robot.</p>
        <p class="description"><a href=https://sigpwny.github.io/>SIGPwny</a> is a cyber security club where students 
            will lead meetings on various topics on information security from game hacking to cryptography. I have 
            attended almost every meeting and stay active in the club by completing challenges on their 
            <a href=http://ctf.sigpwny.com/team/30>capture the flag site</a>.</p>
        <p>In the future I would like to learn more about the programming side of robotics, mainly combining that with 
            machine learning to train and gather data on how a physical robot functions. I am taking classes in both 
            electrical engineering and computer science to understand and bridge the gap between the controls 
            and coding side of a robot.</p>
        <p>I have interned at American Family Insurance in Madison, WI this past summer where I learned a lot about how 
            a large company functions and working in a team. I helped to automate a large section of their data 
            preparation process for reports using Python. I also leveraged Tableau, a data visualization tool, to set 
            guidelines for converting desktop dashboards to mobile phones.</p>
